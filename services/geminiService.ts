---
**WORKFLOW & PARAMETERS:**

**STAGE 1: HYPER-DETAIL GENERATIVE MATTING**
- **Action:** Isolate the primary subject from the original background.
- **Method: CRITICAL - Use Generative Matting.** Do NOT use a simple alpha mask. Instead, analyze the boundary pixels (especially hair, fur, transparent fabrics) and intelligently REGENERATE them. The goal is to preserve 100% of fine details like individual hair strands, avoiding any 'halo' or matted-edge effects. The isolated subject must be perfectly clean.

- **Compositing Method: CRITICAL - Use Hyper-Real Logic.** This is NOT a simple layering. Execute the following in order:
  - **1. Environment Lighting Analysis:** Scan the new background to create a virtual high-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI) map. Identify all light sources, their direction, color temperature, and intensity (e.g., 'large softbox from top-right, warm key light').
  - **2. Subject Re-lighting:** COMPLETELY REMOVE the original lighting from the isolated subject. Then, use the virtual HDRI map to cast new, physically accurate light onto the subject. The subject's lighting, highlights, and shadows MUST match the new environment perfectly.
  - **3. Smart Shadow Casting:** Generate and cast a realistic shadow from the subject onto the new background, based on the identified light sources. The shadow should be soft or hard as dictated by the lighting.
  - **4. Full Harmonization:** Automatically match the subject's color temperature, black levels, white balance, saturation, and film grain to the new background.
  - **5. Seam Blending:** Ensure the final integration is absolutely invisible.

**FINAL INSTRUCTION:** The final image must look like a single, cohesive photograph taken in a professional setting. The composite should be completely undetectable.`;
